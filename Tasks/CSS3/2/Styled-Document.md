**Styled Document Task**

* Create a 'Home' and 'Contact' page with proper layout structure
* Use these basic elements: `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, `<footer>`, and other elements of your choice
* Define nice global styles for both webpages
* Contact page heading and paragraph styles should be different from the home page
* Use `hover`, `active`, and `focus` pseudo-classes
